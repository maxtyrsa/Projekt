<h3>Kupi-Flakon</h3>


This Kupi-Flakon project has great potential for optimizing processes and increasing operational efficiency.  Analyzing the number of collected orders allows you to identify peak operating times and allocate resources more efficiently. Calculating an employee's performance coefficient helps to identify weaknesses in the work of personnel and take measures to improve them.

Researching metrics on the average number of orders over a certain period of time allows you to identify trends and changes in demand for goods. This helps you optimize inventory and manage your production process more efficiently.  Analyzing metrics by day of the week also allows you to optimize the work schedule and distribution of tasks between employees, based on peak load on certain days.

The introduction of automated accounting and data analysis systems in the Kupi-Flakon project significantly simplifies the process of making management decisions and allows you to quickly respond to changes in market conditions. The use of modern analytics technologies helps to increase the efficiency of an online store and improve the quality of customer service.
